In CART algorithm, the objective is to minimize the cost function (Gini Index) at each node. 
Steps of CART Algorithms:

1. Select Root node(S) based on Gini Index and Highest Information Gain

2 . On each iteration of an algorithms it calculate the Gini Index and Information gain, considering that every node is unused

3. Select node base on Lowest Gini Index or Highest I.G

4. then Splits set S to produce the subsets of data

5. An algorithms continuous to recur on each subset and make sure that attributes are fresh and Creates the decision Tree
